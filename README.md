# Jarvis
An Implementation of the Jarvis March Algorithm to complete a convex hull and JUnit testing of the code.

:triangular_ruler::triangular_ruler::triangular_ruler::triangular_ruler:

This code purposefully removes short colinear points and also does not count a linear line as a convex hull, thus only keeping convex hulls with more than 2 points.
